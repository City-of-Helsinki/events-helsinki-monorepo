# Explanation

The files in this folder have been copied over from HDS into this repository. At the time of creating this special case, HDS did not provide direct access to `svg` files. However, these files were used in a way that made it difficult to replace them in place without access to the source `svg` file.

Storing the files here communicates that the suitable replacement files already exist within HDS and that we have knowingly postponed refactoring into using them.
